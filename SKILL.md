# Psychological Type Analysis

Assess psychological type using Carl Jung's original framework—attitudes and functions—to illuminate cognitive style, blind spots, and paths for development.

---

## When to Use

- User wants to understand their cognitive/personality style
- Recurring communication difficulties in relationships
- Career or role fit questions
- Understanding why certain tasks drain or energize
- Conflict with someone whose mind works differently
- User asks "What's my type?" or "Why do we think so differently?"
- Self-awareness and personal development
- Team dynamics and collaboration challenges

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| self_description | Yes | How the user describes their thinking style, preferences, and tendencies |
| situations | No | Specific examples of how they approach problems or decisions |
| conflicts | No | Situations where they felt misunderstood or frustrated |
| energy | No | What activities drain or energize them |

## Jung's Type Theory

Unlike later simplifications (MBTI), Jung's original typology is more nuanced and clinically grounded. It describes how psychic energy flows and how we perceive and judge reality.

### Core Concept

"The classification of individuals means nothing, nothing at all. It is only the instrumentarium for the practical psychologist to explain, for instance, the husband to a wife, or vice versa."

Type is a tool for understanding, not a box. Everyone uses all functions—the question is which are conscious and differentiated, and which remain primitive.

### The Two Attitudes

**Extraversion (E)**
- Psychic energy flows outward toward objects and people
- Oriented to the external world
- Processes by talking and doing
- Energized by interaction

**Introversion (I)**
- Psychic energy flows inward toward the subject
- Oriented to inner experience
- Processes internally before externalizing
- Energized by solitude

*Note: Jung's introversion/extraversion describes energy direction, not social comfort.*

### The Four Functions

Jung identified four functions—two for perceiving reality, two for making judgments:

**Perceiving Functions (Irrational—how we gather information):**

| Function | Focus | Question | Strength | Limitation |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Sensation (S)** | What is present | "What exists right now?" | Concrete reality, details, facts | May miss patterns and possibilities |
| **Intuition (N)** | What could be | "What does this mean? What's possible?" | Patterns, possibilities, big picture | May miss concrete details |

**Judging Functions (Rational—how we evaluate):**

| Function | Focus | Question | Strength | Limitation |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Thinking (T)** | Logical analysis | "Is this true? Does this make sense?" | Objectivity, logic, principles | May neglect values and feelings |
| **Feeling (F)** | Value assessment | "Is this good? What matters here?" | Values, harmony, personal meaning | May rationalize away inconvenient truths |

### The Eight Types

Each function combines with an attitude:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Extraverted Thinking** | Organizes external world logically; builds systems; objective analysis |
| **Introverted Thinking** | Develops internal logical frameworks; theoretical; seeks to understand |
| **Extraverted Feeling** | Harmonizes with external values; socially attuned; creates connection |
| **Introverted Feeling** | Deeply held personal values; intensity beneath calm exterior; authentic |
| **Extraverted Sensation** | Fully engaged with sensory experience; realistic; present-focused |
| **Introverted Sensation** | Compares present to internal impressions; detailed memory; stability |
| **Extraverted Intuition** | Sees possibilities in the outer world; innovative; generates options |
| **Introverted Intuition** | Perceives inner patterns; visionary; sees what's emerging |

### Superior and Inferior Functions

A crucial Jungian concept:

**Superior Function:** Most developed, conscious, differentiated. Where you feel competent.

**Inferior Function:** Least developed, unconscious, primitive. Where you are vulnerable.

The inferior is always the opposite of the superior:
- Thinking ←→ Feeling
- Sensation ←→ Intuition

**Why This Matters:**
- The inferior function is where growth (and trouble) lies
- Under stress, the inferior erupts in primitive form
- Individuation requires befriending the inferior
- Relationships often involve projecting the inferior onto partners

## The Assessment Process

### Step 1: Determine Attitude

Explore energy direction:
- Do you process by talking or by reflecting first?
- Are you energized by interaction or solitude?
- Do you orient primarily to outer events or inner experience?
- When stressed, do you seek people or withdraw?

### Step 2: Identify Perceiving Preference

How do you take in information?
- **Sensation focus:** Concrete, present, specific, factual, step-by-step
- **Intuition focus:** Possibilities, patterns, meanings, future, big picture

### Step 3: Identify Judging Preference

How do you make decisions?
- **Thinking focus:** Logic, analysis, principles, objective criteria
- **Feeling focus:** Values, impact on people, harmony, personal meaning

### Step 4: Determine Superior Function

What function:
- Do you rely on most?
- Feels most natural and effortless?
- Do others recognize as your strength?
- Would you turn to in a crisis?

### Step 5: Identify the Inferior Function

The opposite of the superior:
- Where do you feel primitive, awkward, or easily overwhelmed?
- What function, when used by others, frustrates you?
- Where do you tend to project?
- What emerges when you're extremely stressed?

### Step 6: Consider Development

- What auxiliary functions support the superior?
- How does the inferior show up in life?
- What would development look like?

## Type Dynamics: Common Patterns

### Type Under Stress (Inferior Eruption)

| Superior | Inferior | Stress Pattern |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Thinking | Feeling | Emotional outbursts, sensitivity, feeling unappreciated |
| Feeling | Thinking | Harsh criticism, cold logic, cutting remarks |
| Sensation | Intuition | Catastrophizing, paranoid possibilities, doom focus |
| Intuition | Sensation | Obsessive details, bodily preoccupation, sensory indulgence |

### Type in Relationships

Common attractions/conflicts:
- Opposites attract: We're drawn to our inferior function in others
- Then irritate: What attracted us becomes what frustrates us
- Projection: We see in partners what we won't see in ourselves

---

## Constraints

- **Type is not destiny.** It describes tendencies, not limits.
- **Everyone uses all functions.** The question is differentiation and consciousness.
- **Avoid stereotyping.** Type is a map, not the territory.
- **Context matters.** Work self may differ from home self.
- **Development changes expression.** A mature type looks different from a young one.
- **Don't pathologize.** All types are equally valid.
- **The inferior is not the enemy.** It's the key to growth.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm a software architect. I love designing systems—figuring out how all the pieces fit together. I can spend hours alone working through problems in my head before I write a single line of code. When people ask me to explain my reasoning, I find it frustrating—the logic seems so obvious to me. My wife says I'm 'emotionally unavailable' and that I retreat into my head when things get intense. In meetings, I hate small talk and want to get to the point. I respect competence above everything."

**Output:**

## Psychological Type Analysis

### Primary Attitude: Introversion
**Evidence:**
- Processes problems internally before externalizing ("spend hours alone working through")
- Frustration at having to explain obvious-to-self logic
- Retreats inward under emotional pressure
- Values solitude for deep work

### Function Assessment

**Perceiving Functions:**
- Sensation: Moderate (works with concrete code, but...)
- Intuition: Developed (systems design = seeing how pieces fit; pattern recognition)
**Primary Perceiving:** Intuition

**Judging Functions:**
- Thinking: Highly Developed (logical analysis, systems, frustration at illogical, values competence)
- Feeling: Underdeveloped (wife's feedback about emotional availability; discomfort with relational dynamics)
**Primary Judging:** Thinking

### Type Pattern: Introverted Thinking with Intuition

You lead with **Introverted Thinking**—building internal logical frameworks to understand how things work. Your auxiliary **Intuition** feeds this with patterns, possibilities, and systemic vision. This is the classic architect mind.

### Superior Function: Introverted Thinking (Ti)
**Strengths:**
- Exceptional ability to build coherent internal models
- Sees logical inconsistencies immediately
- Independent, original thinking
- Depth of analysis; comfortable with complexity

**Natural expression:** You understand systems from the inside. Your mind builds frameworks that, once complete, feel self-evidently true. You don't need external validation—logic validates itself.

### Inferior Function: Extraverted Feeling (Fe)
**Challenges:**
- Reading and responding to others' emotional needs
- Creating social harmony and connection
- Expressing appreciation and warmth
- Navigating relational expectations

**How it appears under stress:** When overwhelmed, Fe may erupt as:
- Sudden concern with being liked or valued
- Uncharacteristic emotional displays
- Hypersensitivity to criticism
- Or the opposite: cold dismissiveness, cutting remarks about others' "irrationality"

**Growth opportunity:** Developing Fe would allow you to connect your brilliant insights to people—to lead not just through competence but through relationship. It would also bring more ease in your marriage.

### Auxiliary Functions
Your Intuition (N) serves Thinking by generating possibilities to analyze. Your tertiary Sensation (S) may show up as attention to implementation details. These support the dominant Ti.

### Blind Spots and Projections
**You may:**
- Undervalue emotional intelligence as "illogical"
- Miss relational undercurrents in teams
- Project Feeling onto your wife (she carries the relationship function)
- Dismiss small talk without seeing its connective function
- Assume others should understand what's "obvious"

### Communication Style
**Prefers:** Direct, logical, efficient. Get to the point. Show your reasoning. Respect competence.
**Frustrated by:** Emotional appeals, inefficiency, having to explain the obvious, surface-level engagement, illogical decisions.

### Type in Relationships
**Brings:** Stability, intellectual depth, problem-solving, independence, loyalty once committed
**Needs:** Partner to understand that retreat is processing, not rejection. Space for solitary thinking. Appreciation for the depth they bring, even when not emotionally expressed.
**May project:** Feeling onto partner, then resent them for being "too emotional"—when they're actually carrying the feeling function for both.

### Development Path
**To integrate the inferior (Extraverted Feeling):**

1. **Name emotions.** When you retreat inward, practice naming one emotion before you disappear. "I'm feeling frustrated" is data your wife can work with.

2. **Express appreciation outwardly.** You may feel respect internally; practice saying it. People don't read minds.

3. **Attend to the relational field.** In meetings, occasionally ask: "How is everyone feeling about this direction?" Not because it's logical—because it's connective.

4. **Study Fe practitioners.** Notice people who create warmth and harmony. Instead of dismissing this as fluff, observe the skill involved.

5. **Recognize Fe's logic.** Relationships have their own logic. Your wife's emotional needs are not illogical—they're data in a system you haven't fully mapped.

### The Jungian Perspective
You have a powerful mind that builds internal worlds of coherent understanding. This is a gift. But Jung would say: the inferior function is where individuation happens. Your Introverted Thinking already works well. The growth edge is Extraverted Feeling—the function you're least comfortable with, that frustrates you in others, that your wife embodies.

This is not about becoming someone else. It's about claiming the full range of human capacity that lives, primitively, in you. The architect who can also connect—who can not just design the system but inspire the people who build it—that's the integrated version of you.

*"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."*

What does your frustration with the emotional reveal about what remains undeveloped in you?
